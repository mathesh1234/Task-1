FileHandle Java Application
A simple Java console application that provides basic file handling operations such as writing, reading, appending, and modifying file content using the standard java.io and java.nio.file libraries.

Features
✅ Write content to a file
✅ Read content from a file
✅ Append content to an existing file
✅ Modify file content by replacing specific words
✅ Simple menu-based interface in the terminal
How It Works
The program prompts the user to input a file path and then provides a menu to perform operations on that file. It uses:

BufferedWriter and FileWriter for writing/appending
BufferedReader and FileReader for reading
Files.readAllBytes() and Files.write() for content modification
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
A terminal or IDE to compile and run the Java file
